### 08/11/2025: Setup and Issues with VGGSound

#### **Summary of Work**
- Installed `ffmpeg` and Python on WSL.
- Tried setting up the code for installing VGGSound but faced significant issues due to compatibility and outdated dependencies.

#### **Problems Encountered**
- The repository for VGGSound is MacOS-focused, causing challenges in WSL.
- Conflict between `youtube-dl` and ``yt-dlp``:
    - **Issue**: Repository uses ``pafy`` with ``youtube-dl`` as the backend, which is outdated and doesn't work properly.

#### **Attempts Made**
- Installed ``youtube-dl`` and ``pafy`` on WSL → Unable to find videos.
- Installed ``miniconda`` as suggested with the corresponding Python requirements → Output was ``None``.
- Installed ``yt-dlp`` and manually tested it → Successfully found and downloaded videos but to be implemented for the whole dataset requires major code changes.

#### **Next Steps**
- Option 1: Use Flickr-SoundNet instead of VGGSound.
- Option 2: Ask Xavier for guidance on VGGSound.
- Option 3: Continue working on VGGSound in WSL:
    - Replace pafy code with alternatives like import yt_dlp as pafy.
    - Rewrite the entire code to use yt-dlp.

#### **Time Spent**
The whole day

### 09/11/2025: 
I just decided that I will use Flickr-SoundNet instead of VGGSound.
1. Understand how the code uses this dataset. Now it is written at the study of the code
2. I proved that the dataset is unique and has all the videos that I need, the ones that ``test_flickr_250.txt`` demands
3. Now everything is stored correctly for the Flickr-SoundNet dataset. Now it is time to test the model!

I managed to test the model with Flickr10k, proof:
```shell
TEST dataset size: 249
100%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 249/249 [01:04<00:00,  3.89it/s]
Test:    Epoch: [33]    Loss: 0.0375 Acc@1: 0.0000 Acc@5: 0.0000 MeancIoU: 0.7791 AUC: 0.5927
```
Important things to note:
- I had to change the audio format from ``.wav`` to ``.mp3`` because the repo wants mp3 but torchaudio with soundfile as a backend doesn't support mp3. Since the change of extension should not affect mininmally the audio, I decided to do it. Remember that we use soundfile as a backend because since I use Windows, I can't use ``sox_audio``  for ``torchaudio==0.7.2``.
- I had to change the number of workers from 16 to 8 because it was causing a memory error. The repo origanally could handle 16 workers, but my computer has only 8 cores.
- I had to also upload the xml annotations.
Then finally I could test the model with the Flickr-SoundNet dataset.

Tomorrow:
Understand the results
